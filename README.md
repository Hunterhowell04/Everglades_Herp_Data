# Everglades_Herp_Data
This folder contains the baseline data used within the manuscript titled, "A dry future for the Everglades favors invasive herpetofauna". 
#
This data collected from both the Loxahatchee Impoundment Landscape Assessment and from 118 sites across Everglades National Park represents the largest collection of herpetofaunal community composition in the Everglades. 
#
The community data from LILA (LILA Full Data File) contains all of the individuals collected utilizing all of the methodologies outlined in the paper - subsets of the data were used for the analysis throughout the paper. 
# 
The different columns represent respectively the species collected, the number of individuals collected, the collection method (see methods for an explanation of each methodology), the time observed (if observed during one of the VES/NVES or AVS), the date of collection, the year of collection, the period (these are quarterly samples), location/impoundment/moving from/moving to all represent the locality of collection within LILA and were used to assign individuals to a hydrological regime in the landscape scale experiment.

Data used in the community matrix from Rice et al. is publicly available for download from 
            https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/53bc0c71e4b084059e8bff68 
            # only data collected by VES and AVS were used in this study, data collected from random encounters and drift fences could not be replicated and so were left out.

Data used in the analysis of the 2026 Howell et al. Freshwater Biology paper is also available here. In the file titled, "Comm_Matrix_Final"
